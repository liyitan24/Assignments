The heating lab conducted 5 experiments to study the impacts of insulation material, mixing and hot plate temperature on maintaining a heating temperature within the optimal range for yeast cell growth. The final prototype includes using a 2 cm thick cotton insulation layer and 35\si{\celsius} as the heating temperature. Based on the 24-hour run results, temperature was maintained between 28.5-29.5\si{\celsius}, suggesting the prototype to be effective.
