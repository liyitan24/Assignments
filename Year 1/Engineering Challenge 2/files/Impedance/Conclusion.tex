In conclusion, in order to determine optimal frequency, we graphed the amplitude vs frequency response for the equivalent of saline, or in our case a phosphate buffer solution (PBS), and 100\% concentration with 20 g/L yeast cell solution.
By analysing the frequency responses for both, we arrived at the best averaged between the two, 4 kHz.
By using this frequency we did the calibration curve that was needed in order to monitor the cell-growth over the 24h run. However, from the results shown and discussed in the previous section, it was clear that a series of human errors not only greatly affect the measurements, but completely invalidate them.
For future work, better secured electrodes are perhaps the best recommendation. This is, naturally, equally as important when considering this project's scaling, as the driving and sensing electrodes must both be fixed to the bioreactor tank.
