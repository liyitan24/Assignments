The impedance probe sub-task goal was to research the best settings to have the optimal readings of the solution's impedance, and consequently quantify cell growth.
We begin by defining the position of the driving and sensing electrodes, followed by experimentally determining the frequency at which we can optimally monitor the cells' growth from minimum to maximum concentrations.

Within the frequency band of 1 to 20 kHz there is no concern for cell disruption, and ultimately we found the value of 4 kHz to give the highest output voltages.
Through successive dilutions, we produced a calibration curve against which we could compare the output voltages during the 24h run.
Unfortunately, due to a series of issues surrounding the precarious probe setup, the results collected during the 24h run could not be compared to our calibration curve in a meaningful way.
