In Figure \ref{fig:Topic1-a} the line of symmetry, $x=y$, was plotted.
Because the data are reasonably spread around the line of symmetry, there is evidence for some proportionality between the two data sets.

Given a line $y=ax+b$, the parameters were estimated as per below. This is represented in Figure \ref{fig:Topic1-b}.
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	a &= \frac{90-10}{78-0} = 1.03 \\
	b &= 10
\end{split}
\end{equation}

	\label{fig:Topic1-c}
\end{figure}
By comparing the maximum and minimum fits, we find the uncertainties on slope ($\Delta a$) and y-intercept$(\Delta b)$ to be
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	&Y_{\max} = 1.08x + 10; \quad \quad Y_{\min} = 0.80x + 13 \\
	&\therefore \Delta a = \frac{1.08 - 0.80}{2} = 0.14; \quad \quad \Delta b = 1.5
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\subsection{d}
The general trend is similar, but Matlab calculates a higher y-intercept $(12.7990)$ and a lower slope $(0.8950)$. This suggests that I overvalue the density of points towards the extremity of the graph, while the software appropriately looks at all points equally.
\subsection{e}
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	f(x) &= 0.8950x + 12.7990 \\
	f(60) &= 0.8950\cdot 60 + 12.7990 = 66.499
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Predicted grade would be 66.
\subsection{f}
We could present a more quantitative marker of reliability by measuring the correlation coefficient, but it can also be done qualitatively.
There is a general correlation between exam marks and coursework marks, but the scattering suggests this will be imperfect (have an R-coefficient less than 1).
From the data we have students with coursework marks around 60\% getting exam marks ranging from approximately 40\% to 80\%.
This is a really large spread that covers failing and getting first-class, so while the correlation is there, and it is accurate, it is not precise enough.
