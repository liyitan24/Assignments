\subsection{a}
Given that we want 20 steps of size 0.1, we center the polynomial around $20 \cdot 0.1 = 2$.
We also calculate the integral of the expression, as seen in the matlab code.

\texttt{p(end)} evaluates to 0.0364

\texttt{yb(end)} evaluates to 0.0107

\subsection{c}

By inspection we find that $y(t) = -\frac{1}{4} \cos\left(4t\right)$, and therefore $y(2) = 0.0364$.
As expected, the taylor polynomial gave us a similar answer; however if we look at Figure \ref{fig:taylor}, a period cannot be deduced.
On the other hand, Euler's method, Figure \ref{fig:euler}, gives us an inaccurate value (0.0107), but a very good shape for the graph -- from which we can estimate the period to be 1.5.
From the equation we know the period to be $\frac{2\pi}{4} \approx 1.57$.

By increasing the order of the Taylor polynomial, we are able to reduce this difference significantly.
Below is the same expression with order 100, which can be seen to have a similar shape to Euler's method and more appropriate values.
