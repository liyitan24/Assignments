Manually measured heart rate is the count of beats felt against the carotid artery (MPR) in the period of 10 seconds, therefore the following calculation is performed:
\begin{equation}
    \text{PR (BPM)} = \frac{\text{MPR}}{\SI{10}{s}} \cdot \SI{60}{s.min^{-1}}
\end{equation}

Considerations regarding the two subjects

The variation of machine measured pulse rates seen in Figures 1 and 2 is within expectation.
On the other hand, using the chronometer to measure 10 seconds in which beats would be counted, it was decided that the trailing milliseconds would simply be disregarded.
Not only did the long measurement period exacerbate the variation in the values, but, in reflection, it may have been beneficial to record the times as well, allowing for heart rates which are not multiples of 6.

Focusing on the muscular fatigue of Subject 1, we see a mean ($\mu$) pulse rate of 176 and a standard deviation ($\sigma$) of 4.
This is generally much higher than those achieved during lighter loads and aerobic exercise, which lumped together have $\mu = 160$ -- ultimately falsifying our hypothesis. 

Surprisingly, oxygen saturation was kept largely constant across all sets as can be seen in Figure 3. Indeed, the graph clearly shows the central tendency for each subject.
There is, however, one interesting exception, when subject 1 felt light-headed after a set, the lowest oxygen saturation was measured â€“ 93\%.
This was accompanied by the highest pulse rate, 180 BPM (machine)/168 BPM (manual).
Approximately 5 seconds later, the light-headedness was gone, blood oxygenation shot to 97\% and pulse rate 166 BPM (machine).
This is not represented in the graph, as it is somewhat qualitative.
