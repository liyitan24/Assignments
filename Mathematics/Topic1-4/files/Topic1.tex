In Figure \ref{fig:Topic1-a} the line of symmetry, $x=y$, was plotted.
Because the data are reasonably spread around the line of symmetry, there is evidence for some proportionality between the two data sets.

Given a line $y=ax+b$, the parameters were estimated as per below. This is represented in Figure \ref{fig:Topic1-b}.
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	a &= \frac{90-10}{78-0} = 1.03 \\
	b &= 10
\end{split}
