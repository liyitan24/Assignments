abstract = {'This book presents a balance of theoretical considerations and practical problem solving of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. This book incorporates the results of the last two decades of research on the theories and applications of impedance spectroscopy, including more detailed reviews of the impedance methods applications in industrial colloids, biomedical sensors and devices, and supercapacitive polymeric films. The book covers all of the topics needed to help readers quickly grasp how to apply their knowledge of impedance spectroscopy methods to their own research problems. It also helps the reader identify whether impedance spectroscopy may be an appropriate method for their particular research problem. This includes understanding how to correctly make impedance measurements, interpret the results, compare results with expected previously published results form similar chemical systems, and use correct mathematical formulas to verify the accuracy of the data. Unique features of the book include theoretical considerations for dealing with modeling, equivalent circuits, and equations in the complex domain, review of impedance instrumentation, best measurement methods for particular systems and alerts to potential sources of errors, equations and circuit diagrams for the most widely used impedance models and applications, figures depicting impedance spectra of typical materials and devices, extensive references to the scientific literature for more information on particular topics and current research, and a review of related techniques and impedance spectroscopy modifications'},

abstract = {Despite a general rise in the return to college, likely due to technological change, the cost-benefit calculus facing prospective students can make the decision to invest in and attend college dauntingly complex. Philip Oreopoulos and Uros Petronijevic review research on the varying costs and benefits of higher education and explore in full the complexity of the decision to invest in and attend college. Optimal college attainment decisions are different for all prospective students, who diverge in terms of what they are likely to get out of higher education and what specific options might be best for them. Earnings of college graduates depend in important measure on the program of study and eventual occupation they choose. Students uninterested in or unable to complete a four-year college degree appear to benefit from completing a two-year degree. Prospective students may also face both financial constraints, which prohibit them from taking advantage of more education, and information problems and behavioral idiosyncrasies, such as reluctance to take on debt, which keep them from making optimal decisions about attending college. In their discussion of how student debt figures in the college investment, the authors note that some students borrow too little and, as a result, underinvest in their education. Carefully calculating the return on the college investment can help determine the “appropriate” amount of debt. Students are more likely to benefit from postsecondary education the more informed they are about the expenses associated with college and the potential options for financial aid, which can be extremely complex. To make the best college investment, Oreopoulos and Petronijevic stress, prospective students must give careful consideration to selecting the institution itself, the major to follow, and the eventual occupation to pursue. For any particular program at a particular school, anticipated future labor market earnings, the likelihood of completion, the costs, and the value of any student debt must all be factored into the assessment.},

Heat transfer coefficients were determined using the transient method based on measuring the temperature dependency of the liquid batch on time. A multistage impeller made of two impellers was used in a cylindrical vessel with dished bottom. The lower impeller was a curved blade turbine with the diameter of d = 100 mm and the upper impeller was either a pitched three-blade or pitched four-blade impeller with the diameter of d 1 = 67 mm. Three different impeller clearances in a multistage configuration, H 3 / d 1 = 1, 1.5, and 2, were used in our measurements. The vessel was equipped with two baffles. Experimental results were evaluated using the Euler’s method and nonlinear regression procedure in the Matlab® software and they are summarized in form of Nusselt number correlations describing their dependency on the Reynolds number.},

Nowadays, it has been the most successful sustainable alternative to fossil fuels, even beyond wind power and solar energy, to fuel vehicles and alleviate environmental pollution. Although almost all bioethanol produced by starch- or sugar-based biomass, also known as the first-generation bioethanol, is economically feasible nowadays, it still causes many controversial issues in food security and CO2 emission. In order to address these concerns, the second-generation bioethanol, taking lignocellulose such as forest waste and crop straw as the feedstocks, has emerged a promising future of ideal biofuel. Unfortunately, because of the challenges raised in technology and economy, the running of industrial plants for second-generation ethanol closely depends on the global price of crude oil. The third-generation bioethanol is derived from algae, which is considered as a valuable option for feedstock due to its potentially abounding output. In this chapter, we drew a sketch of three-generation bioethanol in the regular production process and innovative research input globally. Bioethanol production, as a long story since the beginning of civilization, is destined to promise human a bright energy road."

abstract = {A high-throughput parallel reactor system has been designed and constructed to improve the reliability of results from large diameter catalysts such as monoliths. The system, which is expandable, consists of eight quartz reactors, 23.5 mm in diameter. The eight reactors were designed with separate K type thermocouples and radiant heaters, allowing for the independent measurement and control of each reactor temperature. This design gives steady state temperature distributions over the eight reactors within 0.5 ° C of a common setpoint from 50 to 700 ° C . Analysis of the effluent from these reactors is performed using rapid-scan Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic imaging. The integration of this technique to the reactor system allows a chemically specific, truly parallel analysis of the reactor effluents with a time resolution of approximately 8 s . The capabilities of this system were demonstrated via investigation of catalyst preparation conditions on the direct epoxidation of ethylene, i.e., on the ethylene conversion and the ethylene oxide selectivity. The ethylene, ethylene oxide, and carbon dioxide concentrations were calibrated based on spectra from FTIR imaging using univariate and multivariate chemometric techniques. The results from this analysis showed that the calcination conditions significantly affect the ethylene conversion, with a threefold increase in the conversion when the catalyst was calcined for 3 h versus 12 h at 400 ° C .},
