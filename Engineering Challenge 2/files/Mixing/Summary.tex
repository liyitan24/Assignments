This lab includes four comparative experiments to investigate the effects of rotational speed, impeller type, baffles, and number of impellers on liquid mixing time. Based on the results, a bioreactor prototype involving one Rushton Turbine and one Pitched-blade operating at 280rpm under baffled condition was proposed. This design is a scale down model for the optimization of mixing in large scale vaccine production in the Uganda vaccination project.
