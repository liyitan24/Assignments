Data from the four experiments were recorded and plotted in figures. The results were analyzed to propose mixing settings.

According to Figure \ref{fig:RotationalSpeed-MixingTime}, the minimum of each curve indicates the least mixing time for each impeller. Overall, Paddleâ€™s mixing time is longer than that of Pitched-blade or Rushton for the various rotational speed tested. Thus, paddle has been eliminated from our choices of impellers. Comparing the curves of Pitched-blade to Rushton turbine, Pitch-blade achieves mixing under less time for all rotational speeds. This observation is consistent with our hypothesis that Pitched-blade would give the smallest mixing time due to its large impeller diameter. Both Pitched-blade and Rushton reach minimum mixing time at 280rpm, indicating that 280 is the optimal rotational speed that will be used in the final set up.
