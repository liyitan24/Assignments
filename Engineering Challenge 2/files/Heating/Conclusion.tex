The aim of this subtask is to maintain the temperature of the culture system within the optimal range for maximum yeast cell production, by designing a prototype that considers insulation, mixing condition and heat conduction. From our experiments, mixing condition is required for an even distribution of heat, and insulation to minimise heat conduction. Prototype includes a 2cm-think cotton layer and the optimal mixing conditions determined by mixing team. The hot plate is set at 35\si{\celsius} to keep the temperature of the system within the range of 28-33\si{\celsius}. 

For future design, jacketed vessels \cite{VerisovaMarcela2015Htia} can be used to minimise heat loss to the surroundings. Temperature sensor and control system can be placed to monitor and changes the temperature when required by adding or removing heat energy \cite{DellamorteJosephC2007Hrsw}.
