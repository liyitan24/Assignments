The aim of this experiment is to maintain the temperature of the system within the optimal range for maximum yeast cell production, by designing a prototype that considers insulation, mixing condition and heat conduction, and test it on the lab scale reactor under different conditions allowed us to find the best way to create an uniform heat distribution within the reactor as well as steady temperature. From results we obtained from various experiments suggested us mixing condition is required for an even distribution of heat, insulation should also be included to minimise heat conduction. After testing out various insulation methods we concluded 2 cm think cotton is the best insulator, and the optimal mixing conditions is determined by mixing group. The heat plate is set at 35 \si{\celsius}, to allow some heat loss to surroundings while keeping the temperature within the range of 28-33 \si{\celsius}. 

For future design jacketed vessels \cite{VerisovaMarcela2015Htia} can be used to minimise heat loss to the surroundings. Temperature sensor and control system can be placed to monitor and changes the temperature when required by adding or removing heat energy.
