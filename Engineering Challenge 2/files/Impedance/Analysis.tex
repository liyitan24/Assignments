We would want to have more data points in our callibration curve.

We used 250ml to determine the frequency, and 300ml for the callibration curve. We don't expect The difference in ideal frequency per volume to be significant.

The magnetic stirrer left the socket, and as we set it back up, the wires may have moved, changing the distance (and consequently impedance).
While trying to fix it, we saw values ranging from 700 to around 900, and when the stirrer was fixed, we saw values drop to around 600.
