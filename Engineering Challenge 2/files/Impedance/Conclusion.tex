In conclusion, in order to determine optimal frequency, we graphed the amplitude vs frequency response for the equivalent of saline, or in our case a phosphate buffer solution (PBS), and 100\% concentration with 20 g/L yeast cell solution.
By analysing the frequency responses for both, we arrived at the best averaged between the two, 4 kHz.
