General recommendations for electrocardiographs include these minimal requirements: Deviations of linearity and distortion should not exceed the order of 5%. The input impedance between an electrode terminal and ground should not be less than 5 MΩ, and the resistors used for the lead networks should not be less than 3.3 MΩ. In this way, the instrument should not allow currents greater than 10 μA to flow through the patient. The instrument’s response should be within ± 0.5 dB over the frequency range of 0.15–25 Hz. Frequencies up to 100 Hz should not be reduced by more than 3 dB. Detailed mandatory recommendations are or will be given by national regulation authorities (e.g., Bailey et al., 1990).
