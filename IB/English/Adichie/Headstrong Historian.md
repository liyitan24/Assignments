# Narrator
Very matter-of-fact. From the beginning it's a simple third person narrator describing the past, but with a real sense of time progression: "he delayed, and delayed until a sharp pain spliced her back (she's pregnant); and months later she was [...] straining and pushing until the baby slipped out".
Omniscient: "She [Ayaju] wanted Azuka to learn the ways of these foreigners"; "She [Nwamgba] dreamed of killing Obierika's cousins".
Grace is just described as being born and immediately described as a teenager. "the teenager's keen watchfulness"

Omniscience used not only to describe thoughts, but also implied prejudices or terms we would find reprimandable today "[Father Shanahan] found it difficult to estimate the ages of these people"

## Culture clash
Interesting cultural clash: in the missionary school, girls are taught to saw, but in Nwamgba's culture women make pottery; men sow. She accepts it as just silly.

"There was much potential to be harnessed if their wildness could be tamed" – Similar expression to the one used by Gloria Anzaldúa "How to tame a wild tongue", about being Chicana and speaking multiples types of english at the same time.

The balance of how she feels about the cultures: How Nwamgba is first proud that Anikwenwa can use english for the purposes she wanted, but then notices Anikwenwa straying from his culture, losing "the curiosity in his eyes". Proud that he got Obierika's ivory tusk back. Finally when he's completely gone, she wonders whether she "meddled with his destiny".

"[Nwamgba] thought ludicrous how even the gods had changed and no longer asked for palm wine but for gin. had they converted, too?" Narrator describes her thoughts and then quotes her directly. 

Grace/Afamefuna being the opposite of Anikwenwa, and despite her connection to her grandmother, having with her a book titled "The pacification of the primitive tribes of southern nigeria"
"Boarding school would dissolve her granddaughter's fighting spirit and replace it with either an incurious rigidity, like Anikwenwa's, or a limp helplessness, like Mgbeke's."
