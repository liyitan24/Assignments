	The main focus of the paper was initially Riemann's work with the Zeta Function, but as I struggled to understand complex analysis and in general it felt as though the paper was an investigation on what I found interesting in analytical number theory and prime numbers. It was very inspiring to continue attempting to learn and understand Poussin's proof for PNT, and even getting help from a friend with a masters in Math, but ultimately it felt unfruitful in my ``personal'' pursuit.
