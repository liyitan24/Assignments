\begin{enumerate}
	\item Into a conical flask, pour about \SI{10}{ml} of \SI{1.00}{\molar} of \ce{KI} and \SI{10}{ml} of \SI{2.0}{\molar} \ce{HCl}. Utilising a burette, add \SI{5.00\pm0.05}{ml} of the unstandardised KIO3(aq). The reaction will commence immediately.
	\item Titrate the solution with \SI{0.10}{\molar} with the thiosulfate, \ce{Na2S2O3}.
	\item When the shade of yellow disappears from the reaction, \SI{2}{ml} of starch is added, and the titration continues until the blue colour disappears. Expect about 30 ml.
