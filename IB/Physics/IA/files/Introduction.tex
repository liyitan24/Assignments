This paper aims to find the specific heat capacity of cheese by heating a piece of cheese, and placing it inside of a brass cup filled with water and measuring the water's temperature increase.

Measuring the specific heat capacity of cheese should be no different to doing so for a solid, but in researching the topic, ''melting`` cheese became a debating point \textendash\ whether it was just an amorphous substance changing viscosity or an actual change of phase. Furthermore, attempting to handle melted cheese posed an interesting challenge until settling on a procedure that was fairly different from how this type of experiment is done in classrooms. The procedure here could indeed be utilised for many amorphous substances .
