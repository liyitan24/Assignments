	abstract = {The electrocardiogram (ECG) is currently the most widely used recording to diagnose cardiac disorders, including the most common supraventricular arrhythmia, such as atrial fibrillation (AF). However, different types of electrical disturbances, in which power-line interference (PLI) is a major problem, can mask and distort the original ECG morphology. This is a significant issue in the context of AF, because accurate characterization of fibrillatory waves (f-waves) is unavoidably required to improve current knowledge about its mechanisms. This work introduces a new algorithm able to reduce high levels of PLI and preserve, simultaneously, the original ECG morphology.},
