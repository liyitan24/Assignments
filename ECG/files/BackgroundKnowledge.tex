\begin{itemize}
    \item Band-pass filter, consisting of a high-pass and a low-pass filter.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item High-pass blocks DC offsets
        \item Low-pass high-frequency components not a part of the ECG signal
    \end{itemize}
    \item \SI{50}{\hertz} notch filter (Filter out mains-noise)
    \item Electrosurgery/Surgical diathermy filter
\end{itemize}

\textbf{EDIT THIS}``Usually, the frequency spectrum of normal ECG signal range from 0.01 Hz to 100 Hz and 90\% spectral energy of the signal focus on 0.25 Hz to 35 Hz. The noise of ECG signal frequency is mainly distributed in the two bands. One is the baseline drift which is generated by breathing and muscle motion and mainly in 0.05 $\sim$ 2 Hz.'' \citep{JianqiangLi2017DoaR}
